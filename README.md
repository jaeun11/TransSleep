> **Abstract:** *Sleep staging is essential for sleep assessment and plays a vital role as one of the health indicators. Due to its capability, recent studies exploited and devised various machine learning as well as deep learning architectures for sleep staging. However, two important challenges hinder their practical use. Specifically, to effectively capture salient waveforms in sleep signal and to correctly classify confusing stages in transitioning epochs are rarely easy. In this work, we propose a novel deep neural network structure that that can capture local temporal patterns and exploits two auxiliary tasks to distinguish confusing stages. Particularly, our proposed framework adopts an attention-based multi-scale feature extractor for identifying the salient waveforms. A stage-confusion estimator with a novel auxiliary task, epoch-level stage classification, estimates confidence scores for confusing stages. A context encoder with another novel stage-transition detection auxiliary task represents contextual relationships across neighboring epochs. With the estimated information by two auxiliary tasks as well as architectural strength, our proposed method shows promising results for the automatic sleep staging. We demonstrated the validity of our proposed method on two publicly available datasets Sleep-EDF and MASS by achieving state-of-the-art performances. Moreover, we analyzed the results from diverse perspective with ablative cases. Based on our results, we believe that the proposed network has immense potential to provide new insights in deep learning-based sleep staging.*
